# gammaray


Repository of the GammaRay geostatistics software.

Abstract:
GammaRay is a graphical user interface (GUI) that automates geostatistical workflows by driving and coordinating the several modules of the renowned Geostatistical Software Library (GSLib).  The main purpose of GammaRay is to add a user-friendly interface layer on top of the scientifically and numerically robust GSLib, greatly automating parameter file editing and module chaining so the practitioner can focus on geostatistics.  GammaRay was conceived as a free and portable alternative to WinGSLib®, which is a commercial software available only for Microsoft Windows® users.  GammaRay is also open source and thus is subject to code review and can receive contributions from other software developers as well as user feedback, suggestions and bug reports.  GammaRay is built with the C++ programming language upon the famous Qt library to leverage the construction of a modern and platform independent graphical user interface.<br><br>
